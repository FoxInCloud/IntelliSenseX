<p>IntellisenseX can be used to display the fields from data objects that are based on an underlying table in a business object or in a form or visual class based on an underlying table, although doing so requires customization on your part.</p>
<p>The sample below accesses the underlying table that the current class is based on (found in “This.cAlias”) whenever “This.oData.” is entered.</p>

<p>Customization is achieved by modifying a Plug-in PRG. </p>
<p>The Plug-In is called when IntellisenseX has exhausted all other possible interpretations of the text before the dot. In this example, it is called with “This.oData” as a parameter and also the object reference to the class being edited, and the Plug-In
 is free to determine the list of items to appear in the dropdown.&nbsp; In this example, the name of the underlying table is determined from the property “This.cAlias”</p>
